/*! \class E3StripData
  \brief Base class describing the portion of the event contribution relative
  to a single RPC strip.

  This encapsulates the identifiers of the plane and the channel, along
  with the timestamps of all the (rising and falling) edges on both
  sides of the plane.

  We have all the information, here, to extract the three-dimensional hit
  (or hits) to be passed to the clustering stage, with all the associated
  physical quantities.

  As it turns out, this class is not as trivial as one might naively think.
  The Rpc strips are read out from both sides---the difference in the arrival
  times giving the coordinate along the strips.
  
  At the digi level we keep track of the arrival times of both the raising
  and the falling edges at both sides. We might have one or more edges of
  each type at both ends (e.g., noise can cause spurious hits). We can even
  have "orphane" transitions, if the signal in a channel is already up when
  the readout starts or didn't have time to return to the baseline when the
  readout stops.

  Here we try and associate the "right" rising edges in order to have the
  longitudinal position along the strip. We might also try and extract some
  meaningful information from the time over threshold.
